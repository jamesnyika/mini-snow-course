# UI actions

UI actions are custom actions you can add to a page to perform some action such as change values on a form, modify records, or perform tasks similar
to business rules but *based on user input*

User action configuration can be previewed [here]()

Here is an example UI Action

Here this button has been added to the form to allow the user to kick off notifications to the target commands of their pre-work tasks. The UI button does

Here is the empty implementation of the button

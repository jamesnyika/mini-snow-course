# Service Portals

Service Portals are the mechanism by which ServiceNow builds internet and intranet websites. They are built hierarchically using widgets which
can be customized. Each service portal is its own site. To build a ServicePortal you only need to know HTML, CSS and Javascript. Some familiarity with the
ServiceNow Javascript apis will speed up your transition.

## Building Service Portals

To build a service portal, you need to first plan out your layouts and structure. Figure out items such as

* What headers and footers will I use ?
* How will I handle my backgrounds ?
* What parts of my pages and screens will need to be interactive for the user ?
* How many pages should I build ?

## The process

Once you have answered some of these basic questions, you will need to then construct
* A page and its layouts
* Drag in widgets to the pages
* Preview pages
* Iterate

This process can be tedious and laborious but it is the way a majority of websites are built. 

## Assignment

* Create a simple service portal where you drag in widgets from existing pages
* Try creating a modified widget starting with the Hello World Widget

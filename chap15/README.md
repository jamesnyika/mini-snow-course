# Record Producers and Catalog Items

Record Producers are forms that can be configured to add a row to any table. A catalog item is a self service option that you can expose to an end user in a Servicenow
Service portal to allow self service or to initiate a process.

We use record producers in conjuction with catalog items to create catalogs of actions.

## Record Producers

table and ensuring that you expose them appropriately on the correct catalog.

# Reconfiguring the User Interface
In studio you can now redefine the user interface for your application. First take a step to review what your form looks like by going to the filter navigation and looking for your application.  Select any record and click on new to see a sample form that is autogenerated for you.  You may or may not like this new form and would like to make modifications to it. In this section we learn how.

## Opening the form editor

In studio, select any one of the forms that have been autocreated for you and you should see something like this:

You can try the following:

 * Drag new fields into the canvas from the left side
 * Create a completely new field on the form.
 * Create a new section, rename it and add new fields into it
 * Modify an existing field's settings (the cog on the right) and change its size or even default value

 For each of these changes, you can save the change and then review the actual changes to the form.


 ## Opening the Form Layout Manager

 An alternative method for modifying forms is to use the layout manager. You can access this from any form by right clicking (on Mac it is ctrl-click) to show a menu. Select Form Layout and you get a screen like this:

# Managing Updates and Sources
As you make all these changes you will need to secure them back in some kind of repository.
Here -we learn to set up your link to the repo.

## Git Repository Configuration
Studio provides a mechanism for you to link to a source control repository. Currently git is the only repository supported.
To access it, go to the 'Source Control' menu and select Link to Source control.

# Menus and Access
Menus in ServiceNow are called modules. Modules can be accessed from the filter navigation and there are many kinds.
The quickest way to access modules is to edit one to see what they contain. In the filter navigation click on the pencil icon next to any item

![ModuleEdit](https://github.com/jamesnyika/motivf-snow/blob/master/chap7/images/ModuleEditor.png)

and it will display the following module editor screen

##  Creating Menus in Studio

In studio, 'Create Application File' and search for Module

![Sample Form Designer](https://github.com/jamesnyika/motivf-snow/blob/master/chap7/images/CreateModule.png)

Notice that you can create more than one module type. One for mobile devices or just for the desktop browser Application

Once opened, you can see the detail and the types of modules you can create

![Sample Form Designer](https://github.com/jamesnyika/motivf-snow/blob/master/chap7/images/CreateModule2.png)


You can try the following:

 * Add additional modules
 * Create a List Module
 * Create a Module that shows a URL on the web like www.motivf.com

Notice that modules can be saved to the favorites tab by clicking on the star invocation

### Tasks
1. See if you can put order into your Modules
2. See if you can nest your modules under other Modules

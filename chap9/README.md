# Creating Reports
ServiceNow has a built in reporting engine. You can access the configuration screens quite readily from the list menu or searching in the filter navigation for
'Report'. Once there you can 'Create New' to create a new report.

This [link] (https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/kingston-performance-analytics-and-reporting/page/use/reporting/concept/c_GenerateReports.html) on the ServiceNow website provides a good overview on how to create reports. However in this section we want to look at how to think about report creation with an eye to Creating
meaningful dashboards.

### Building Meaningful reports
Reports are a form of output from a system - the provide a mechanism to consume processed data.  It is important when designing reports to consider

* The Audience or Recipient
* The Use of the report - to inform and provide visibility, or support a decision
* Fitness for purpose
* Fitness for Use


### Tasks
1. Configure your project to link to your git repo
2. Commit your changes to your git repo
3. Try and stash changes and then re-apply them over an update you made later.

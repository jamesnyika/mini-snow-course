# Reusing Existing Visualizations on the platform
There is a host of different visualizations on the ServiceNow platform that you can reuse for your applications.
These include:

* Bubble Charts
* Prioritization Bubble charts
* The CIO Dashboard - a type of timeline
* Or you can create your own for display in a service portal.

For this section we will try and reuse the heat map chart visualization
